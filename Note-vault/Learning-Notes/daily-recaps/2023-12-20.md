### today results:

1-- as we can see the first entry from london was a SL and the reason i think is it's not too discount area for long trade 
note : 
it's can be a TP if i took the trade with 2R and entry point will be after the breaker form.

2-- new york session was more clear after price reach a discount PDA and give us BRK entry and as always full TP at 2R.
today summary:
- 1 SL
- 1 TP
note: it's can be different with a risk management system .
